# CountryLookup

My project allows the user to input any country name and receive that country's population, flag, and region. When I first started on my original project, I struggled a lot with Spotify's API, which required a key and tokens. I overcame this challenge by choosing REST API, which is open and doesn't require keys or tokens. I learned a lot while creating this project, and I think its ability to return pictures sets it apart. Although my project does meet all the requirements, I hope to add complexity to it in the future by allowing it to sort through countries based on parameters choosen by the user.
